# Course Management System Project

To begin using this code, edit the file "personal.py" where you must enter the values for "HOST_NAME", "USERNAME", "PASSWORD" in the exact format and fill in each variable with string of your MySQL Workbench host name, username, and password respectively. You must also edit the remaining values in "personal.py" with your own own values.

Then in the command line, execute the "database_init.py" to initialize the database and tables. Now, you can execute the other program files using the command "python [file name].py" in the terminal. The essential files for this program are "courses_module.py", "personal.py", "database_init.py", "queries.py", "delete_course.py", "add.py", "read.py", and "update.py". These files will allow you to use CRUD operations on the database while the rest of the files will do similar actions to refine your program.
